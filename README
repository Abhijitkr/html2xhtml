both Cygwin and MinGW). If compiled in Cygwin, the program depends
on "cygwin1.dll". 


HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

html2xhtml [<input_html_file>] [-c <input_encoding>] 
           [-d <input_encoding>] [-t <output_doctype>] [-e]

html2xhtml reads the HTML input file and converts it to XHTML. The output 
of the conversion is written in standard output. Warnings and errors
are notified through standard error.


OPTIONS:

<input_html_file>    Input HTML file to be converted to XHTML.
                     If not provided, the input file is taken from
                     standard input.

-c <input_encoding>  Encoding of the input HTML file. Overrides automatic
                     input encoding detection (please, read the note about
                     input encodings bellow).

-d <input_encoding>  Default input encoding, if it is not automatically
                     detected from the input. By default, ISO-8859-1
                     (please, read the note about input encodings bellow).

-e                   Instructs the program to propagate input chunks to 
                     the output even if it is unable to adapt them to
                     the output XHTML doctype. Using this option, 
                     the XHTML output may be non-valid. Not using this
                     option, some input data could be removed from the
                     output in some [rare] cases.
                     
-t <output_doctype>  Doctype of the output XHTML file. If not specified,
                     the program selects automatically either 
                     XHTML 1.0 Transitional or XHTML 1.0 Frameset 
                     depending on the input. Current available
                     doctypes are:
                     * 'transitional' XHTML 1.0 Transitional
                     * 'frameset'     XHTML 1.0 Frameset
                     * 'strict'       XHTML 1.0 Strict
                     * '1.1'          XHTML 1.1
                     * 'basic-1.0'    XHTML Basic 1.0
                     * 'basic-1.1'    XHTML Basic 1.1
                     * 'mp'           XHTML Mobile Profile
                     * 'print-1.0'    XHTML Print 1.0

HTML ENCODINGS:

This program only works for input encodings that code every ASCI
character (0-127) only with one byte. This includes, for example,
ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-15, UTF-8. However, the program does not work
for encoding UTF-16. For converting UTF-16 files, please convert it 
first to UTF-8.
