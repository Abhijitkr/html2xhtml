HOW TO COMPILE AND INSTALL THE PROGRAM
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Enter the main directory of the source distribution and type:

$ ./configure
$ make 

If you want to install the program in your system, type then (it may
require root priviledges):

$ make install

See ./INSTALL for more information.

The program has been tested to compile on GNU/Linux and Windows (in
both Cygwin and MinGW). If compiled in Cygwin, the program depends
on "cygwin1.dll". 


HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

html2xhtml [<input_html_file>] [-c <input_encoding>] 
           [-d <input_encoding>] [-t <output_doctype>] [-e]
           [-o <output_file>]
           [-l <line_length>] [-b <tab_length>]
           [--preserve-space-comments] [--no-protect-cdata]
           [--compact-block-elements]

html2xhtml reads the HTML input file and converts it to XHTML. The
output  of the conversion is written in standard output or in the file
specified with the "-o" option. Warnings and errors are notified
through standard error.


OPTIONS:

<input_html_file>    Input HTML file to be converted to XHTML.
                     If not provided, the input file is taken from
                     standard input.

-o <output_file>     Output XHTML file. The file is overwritten if it
                     exists. If not provided, the output is written to
                     standard output.

-c <input_encoding>  Encoding of the input HTML file. Overrides automatic
                     input encoding detection (please, read the note about
                     input encodings bellow).

-d <input_encoding>  Default input encoding, if it is not automatically
                     detected from the input. By default, ISO-8859-1
                     (please, read the note about input encodings bellow).

-e                   Instructs the program to propagate input chunks to 
                     the output even if it is unable to adapt them to
                     the output XHTML doctype. Using this option, 
                     the XHTML output may be non-valid. Not using this
                     option, some input data could be removed from the
                     output in some [rare] cases.
                     
-t <output_doctype>  Doctype of the output XHTML file. If not specified,
                     the program selects automatically either 
                     XHTML 1.0 Transitional or XHTML 1.0 Frameset 
                     depending on the input. Current available
                     doctypes are:
                     * 'transitional' XHTML 1.0 Transitional
                     * 'frameset'     XHTML 1.0 Frameset
                     * 'strict'       XHTML 1.0 Strict
                     * '1.1'          XHTML 1.1
                     * 'basic-1.0'    XHTML Basic 1.0
                     * 'basic-1.1'    XHTML Basic 1.1
                     * 'mp'           XHTML Mobile Profile
                     * 'print-1.0'    XHTML Print 1.0

-l <line_length>     Number of characters per line. The default value is 80.
                     It must be greater or equal to 40, otherwise the 
                     parameter is ignored.

-b <tab_length>      Tab length in number of characters. It must be a number
                     between 0 and 16, otherwise the parameter is ignored.
                     Use 0 to avoid indentation in the output.

--preserve-space-comments
                     Use this option to preserve white spaces, tabs and 
                     ends of lines in HTML comments. The default, if not 
                     provided, is to rearrange spacing.

--no-protect-cdata   Enclose CDATA sections in "script" and "style" following
                     the XHTML 1.0 specification (using "<!CDATA[[" and
                     "]]>"). It might be incompatible with some browsers.
                     The default in this version is to enclose CDATA sections
                     using "//<!CDATA[[" and "//]]>", because major browsers
                     handle it properly. 

--compact-block-elements
                     No white spaces or line breaks are written between  
                     the start tag of a block element and the start tag 
                     of its first enclosed inline element (or character 
                     data) and between the end tag of its last enclosed 
                     inline element (or character data) and the end tag 
                     of the block element. By default, if this option is
                     not set, a new line character and indentation is
                     written between them.

HTML ENCODINGS:

This program only works for input encodings that code every ASCI
character (0-127) only with one byte. This includes, for example,
ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-15, UTF-8. However, the program does not work
for encoding UTF-16. For converting UTF-16 files, please convert them 
first to UTF-8. UTF-8 is not guaranteed to work always properly, and
more testing is required.
